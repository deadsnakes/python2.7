README.source for python2.5
---------------------------
The package uses the "3.0 (quilt)" source format so patches recorded in
debian/patches/series are applied automatically. However, since some patches
might modify `configure.in` without also patching `configure` (which is
generated from `configure.in`, so that would be pointless), `debian/rules`
provides a `patch` target that regenerates `configure`. The build process will
perfom this step automatically if required, however.
