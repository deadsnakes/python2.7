# Add /usr/include/ncursesw for the _curses and _cursespanel modules. Prior to
# precise, libreadline-dev would pull in libncurses5-dev which provides
# /usr/include/curses.h; but that's kinda wrong and doesn't work in precise
# anymore (at least on amd64), so we just use the correct include path right
# away. See also:
