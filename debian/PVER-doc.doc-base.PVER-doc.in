Title: Documenting Python (v@VER@)
Author: Fred L. Drake, Jr.
Abstract: The Python language has a substantial body of documentation, much
 of it contributed by various authors. The markup used for the Python
 documentation is based on LATEX and requires a significant set of
 macros written specifically for documenting Python. This document
 describes the macros introduced to support Python documentation and
 how they should be used to support a wide range of output formats.
 .
 This document describes the document classes and special markup used
 in the Python documentation. Authors may use this guide, in
 conjunction with the template files provided with the distribution,
 to create or maintain whole documents or sections.
